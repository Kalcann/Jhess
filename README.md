# Jhess
Jhess is a light-weight Java based chess application that I produced in my free time.
This project is completely open source though I would appreciate any shout outs if you do end up reposting the code.

The project is still in early develpment and will be updated on a somewhat sporatic basis.

As this is a personal project all choices are my own howver I am always open to public opinion try and remedy any bugs that arise.
